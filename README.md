# Decentralized Lottery

## Project Description

The Decentralized Lottery is a smart contract-based lottery system where anyone can participate by sending a fixed amount of ETH. The winner is selected randomly, and the entire prize pool is transferred to their address. The process is transparent, and the contract ensures fair play without relying on a centralized authority.

## Project Vision

The vision behind this project is to create a fair, transparent, and trustless lottery platform powered by blockchain technology. By leveraging smart contracts, users can participate in lotteries without worrying about manipulation or lack of transparency, as all operations are performed by code and visible on-chain.

## Key Features

- **Open Participation:** Anyone can join the lottery by sending the required ETH.
- **Random Winner Selection:** The contract randomly picks a winner from the pool of participants.
- **Transparent Process:** All transactions and lottery operations are recorded on the blockchain.
- **Fair Payout:** The winner automatically receives the prize directly from the contract.

## Future Scope

- Integration with Chainlink VRF for provably fair randomness.
- Multiple lottery rounds with configurable entry fees and rewards.
- Front-end dApp interface for seamless participation.
- Support for various tokens and NFT-based prizes.
- Referral and loyalty programs to incentivize users.
